Description:
Convert the IntegerList ADT on the course webpage from a List of ints to a List-of-anything using Java
Generics. Use as starting point either the Linked List version or the Array Doubling version, both found on
the course website under Examples/Lecture/IntegerListADT/. Your new generic type will be called simply
List and will be defined in a file called List.java. Your List class will implement a generic List interface 
5
defined in the file ListInterface.java also found on the webpage under Examples/Labs/lab6/. Test your
List by writing a file called ListTest.java that exercises all ADT operations. The same directory contains
files ListIndexOutOfBoundsException.java, ListClient.java, Makefile and model-out.
The Makefile makes the executable jar file ListClient which should produce output identical to the
contents of model-out, provided that your List ADT works properly. Notice that the exception class
contains another annotation @SuppressWarnings("serial"), without which you would receive warnings
under -Xlint about the lack of a serialVersionUID definition. It seems a hassle to deal with all of these
warnings regarding aspects of Java that we have not studied, and it is tempting to just drop use of the -Xlint
compiler flag to get rid of them. This is not recommended however, since warnings are our first line of
defense against logical problems in our code. You may alter the provided Makefile, but the one you turn in
must include the -Xlint flag when compiling Java sources.
