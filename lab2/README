Description:
Write a java program called FileReverse.java that takes two command line arguments giving the names
of the input and output files respectively (following the preceding examples). Your program will read each
line of input, parse the tokens, then print each token backwards to the output file on a line by itself. For
example given a file called in containing the lines:
abc defg
hi
jkl mnop q
rstu v
4
wxyz
the command %FileReverse in out will create a file called out containing the lines:
cba
gfed
ih
lkj
ponm
q
utsr
v
zyxw
Your program will contain a recursive method called stringReverse() with the following signature:
public static String stringReverse(String s, int n)
This function will return a String that is the reversal of the first n characters of s. Note that reversing a
String recursively is very similar to reversing an array. Study the methods in the String class documented at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/ to determine how this might be done. See especially the instance
methods charAt() and substring(), as well as the static method valueOf(). Base your reversal
strategy on one of the recursive methods reverseArray1() or reverseArray2() discussed in class, or
on the methods of the same name in pa1. Use stringReverse() to perform the reversal of tokens from
the input file.
