Description:
Your goal in this project will be to translate the Binary Search Tree (BST) based Dictionary in C, posted
on the webpage, into Java. The files
DictionaryInterface.java
DuplicateKeyException.java
KeyNotFoundException.java
DictionaryClient.java
are provided in the examples section of the webpage, and should be submitted unchanged with this
project. The file model-out contains the correct output of the program DictionaryClient.java.
You are to write the implementation file Dictionary.java and submit it with the above files, along
with a Makefile that creates an executable Jar file called DictionaryClient. Note that although you
should test your ADT operations independently as usual, you will not submit a file called
DictionaryTest.java with this project.
Dictionary.java will implement all operations in DictionaryInterface.java using a BST as the
underlying data structure. Begin by studying the file Dictionary.c found on the webpage at
Examples/Lecture/C_Programs/DictionaryADT/. Notice that the C version contains a number of private
helper functions used by the ADT operations. It is strongly suggested that you write these same methods
into your Java implementation, as private functions of course.
